(memo)
----
As of February 16, 2022, I think the bug exists because I have only confirmed successful creation once.

-> fix some bugs and modify behavior. 


-------
(usage)
-------


    python open_multiple.py
    
Check the account information in the generated account.txt or standard output.

If "confirmation successful" is filled in, the email confirmation is also successful.
